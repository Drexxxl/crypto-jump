# SpaceJump

A simple Phaser + React mini game inspired by Doodle Jump. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to play.

This project uses ES modules from CDNs so no build step is required. Just serve the files with any static server or open `index.html` directly.

Use the left/right arrow keys or A/D to steer the rocket while playing.
Navigate through menu tabs (Quests, Leaderboard, Collections, Market, Referrals, Profile) from the main menu.
