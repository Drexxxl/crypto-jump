# SpaceJump

A simple Phaser + React mini game inspired by Doodle Jump. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to play.

This project uses ES modules from CDNs so no build step is required. Just serve the files with any static server or deploy the repository as a static site. For example, you can deploy it to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) by creating a new project from this repository.

Use the pointer (touch or mouse) to move the rocket left and right while playing. Navigate through menu tabs (Quests, Leaderboard, Collections, Market, Profile) from the main menu.
